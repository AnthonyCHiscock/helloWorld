First Repository- ideas, starter projex,etc. 
Hello! My name is Anthony. I'm a very beginner programming that has surfaced from the endless boredom that is quarintine.
I'm a 22 year old college dropout that has been interested in programming for awhile now but have finally decided to give it a go!
Wish me luck!
